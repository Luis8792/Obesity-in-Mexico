       <div> While the out-of-pocket expenditure of Mexicans is one of the highest in the world,
         the budget of the Ministry of Health has decreased more than 20% in real terms during 
        the six-year term. </div>

        by a chronic illness could have an out-of-pocket expense of 20%. </div>
